### Instructions for installing required softwares
*All installations are done on Windows 10 unless otherwise specified*
#### Installing Python 3.5
Download and install [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) (tested working with v3.5.3)
#### Installing PyQt for GUI app development
##### Option 1: Install from executable
- Download the PyQt5-5.6-gpl-Py3.5-Qt5.6.0-x64-2.exe from [this link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/files/PyQt5/PyQt-5.6/) and execute it to install QtDesigner.
- Launch QtDesigner from Start Menu.
##### Option 2: Install using `pip` Python package manager
- In Commmand Line, type in:
```bash
pip install PyQt5
pip install pyqt5-tools
```
- To launch QtDesigner, go to `C:\Users\***\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35\Lib\site-packages\pyqt5_tools` and launch `designer.exe` 
*(replace `***` with corresponding username on Windows)*

A quick guide to PyQt can be found [here](https://www.pythonforengineers.com/your-first-gui-app-with-python-and-pyqt/).

####Using UI file generated by QtDesigner in main program
##### Option 1: Directly load UI files generated by PyQt
Example code: 
```bash
from PyQt5 import uic, QtWidgets
import sys

class Ui(QtWidgets.QDialog):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Ui, self).__init__()
        uic.loadUi('GUI_design.ui', self)
        self.show()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = Ui()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```
This option causes more overhead and prevents support for code completion.
##### Option 2: Use pyuic to compile UI file as Python class
```bash
pyuic5.exe gui.ui -o gui.py -x
```
This option is a bit more inconvenient as the UI file has to be recompiled every time changes are made to the GUI design. However, code completion is supporrted with this method.

### Threading in PyQt5 GUI app
If threading is not used, trying to fetch data from other classes will cause following problems:
- The main thread is locked
- The GUI isn't updated until the process finishes
- All GUI elements are no longer functional even though they appear to be.
- No way to stop the execution once the function is started.
