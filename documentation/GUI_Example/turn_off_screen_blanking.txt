Install 
apt-get install x11-xserver-utils
Edit /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart
Append these lines:

@xset s noblank
@xset s off
@xset -dpms
Possibly also comment out the line that says @xscreensaver -no-splash, 
so the complete file should look something like this:

@lxpanel --profile LXDE
@pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE
# @xscreensaver -no-splash

@xset s noblank
@xset s off
@xset -dpms

Also edit /etc/kbd/config and make sure these values are set as follows 
(however I believe this is only for when the lightweight desktop (LXDE) 
is not running (i.e. the pi is still in text / terminal mode):

BLANK_TIME=0
BLANK_DPMS=off
POWERDOWN_TIME=0

I believe that the /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart may be the sort 
of system-wide version of ~/.xinitrc but someone else probably knows 
the nuances better.
